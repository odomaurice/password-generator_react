  #ABOUT THE PROJECT

After learning Reactjs, I decide to build projects with what I learnt. And so I came across variety of projects which I will build gradually to solidify my learning of React, for practice is the best form of learning. Therefore I came across Megha Paul's project which helped me to a great extent in building this project.

This project is geared towards making it easy to generate a secure password, the flexibility of the project is evident in the user being able to generate password of a desired length and mixed with uppercase, lowercase, numerical and special characters. This is however the beta version of this application as I intend to improve on the features of this application especially with regard to the storage of user data.

Have any suggestions, want work with this, just clone the repository, create new branch.

Work, push changes and create pull request for merge.

To install all the packages, run:
                      npm install.
                      
                      
 I tried as much as possible with refactoring and comments to make the app readable and easy to follow.
